单继承

```python
>>> class A(object):
...     def say_a(self):
...             print('A is a')
>>> class B(A):
...     def say_a(self):
...             print('B is b')
... 
>>> class C(B):
...     def say_a(self):
...             print('C is c')

>>> class D(C):
...     def say(self):
...             print("D is d")
...             super(D,self).say_a()
...             super(C,self).say_a()
...             super(B,self).say_a()
... 
>>> D().say()
D is d
C is c
B is b
A is a

```

```python
>>> class  A(object):
...     def  say(self):
...             print("A is a")
... 
>>> class B(A):
...     def  say(self):
...             print("B is b")
...             super(B,self).say()
... 
>>> class C(A):
...     def say(self):
...             print("C is c")
...             super(C,self).say()
... 
>>> class D(B,C):
...     def say(self):
...             print("D is d")
...             super(D,self).say()
... 
>>> d = D() 
>>> d.say()
D is d
